### Black Hole Mimickers

We investigated the properties of particle collisions in the vicinity of compact objects that deviate from the usual black hole solutions of general relativity. We assumed static axisymmetric spacetimes where the spherical symmetry is broken by the presence of some quadrupole. As test metrics, we used two well-known Weyl solutions, the Erez-Rosen and the Zipoy-Voorhees solution. We calculated the center of mass energy for particle collisions that take place at the ISCO and find it to depend on the deformation parameters. We also investigated the "near-horizon" collisions and find that the behavior deviates from that of Schwarzschild, particularly in the case of prolate deformations. This work was done under the supervision of Professor Daniele Malafarina at Nazarbayev University.

### Star Formation

We analyzed the relative orientation of the magnetic field structure in Monoceros OB1 region, which is important for the understanding of how the magnetic field affects the evolution of the interstellar medium and the formation of stars. I used Rolling Hough Transform to run the detection algorithms for data from Planck and Herschel telescopes. The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure. In this work, Hough transform was concerned with the identification of lines in the image. To analyze the direction of the filaments, I reconfigured the intensity map making it "skeleton"-structured. Because the "skeleton" is a sequence of points, it helped to find a clear point of branching of the filaments by the "neighboring method". This work was conducted under Dr. Dana Alina and Professor Ernazar Abdikamalov at Nazarbayev University.
