We analyzed the relative orientation of the magnetic field structure in Monoceros OB1 region, which is important for the understanding of how the magnetic field affects the evolution of the interstellar medium and the formation of stars. I used Rolling Hough Transform to run the detection algorithms for data from Planck and Herschel telescopes. The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure. In this work, Hough transform was concerned with the identification of lines in the image. To analyze the direction of the filaments, I reconfigured the intensity map making it "skeleton"-structured. Because the "skeleton" is a sequence of points, it helped to find a clear point of branching of the filaments by the "neighboring method". This work was conducted under Dr. Dana Alina and Dr. Ernazar Abdikamalov at Nazarbayev University.
