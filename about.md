Hi! I am an Astrophysics graduate student at Stony Brook University, originally from Kazakhstan. I work with [Phil Armitage](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/parmitage/) and [Will Farr](https://farr.github.io/), and my scientific interests span planet formation, orbital architecture of exoplanets, and stellar magnetic activity. In general, I have broad interests, and I am always open to any project ideas. You can also find me at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics) (Flatiron Institute), where I am always happy to chat about science over a cup of coffee! You can find my academic CV <a href="/CV/cv_Sabina_Sagynbayeva.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am passionate about supporting minorities in science and improving DEI, and science communication. As a woman in STEM, I am always happy to help other fellow women in STEM. [Contact me](https://ssagynbayeva.github.io/contact) if you have interesting DEI initiatives ideas! 

When I don't think about my research, I am a singer-songwriter and a musical theater nerd. In 2020, I started releasing my songs that I wrote and fully/partially produced. You can find them [here](https://ssagynbayeva.github.io/music).
