Hi! I am an Astrophysics graduate student at Stony Brook University, originally from Kazakhstan. I work with Phil Armitage, and my scientific interests span planet formation, accretion disks, and exoplanets.

I am passionate about supporting minorities in science and improving DEI. 

When I don't think about my research, I am a singer-songwriter and an amateur photographer.
