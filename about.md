Hi! I am an Astrophysics graduate student at Stony Brook University, originally from Kazakhstan. I work with [Phil Armitage](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/parmitage/), and my scientific interests span planet formation, accretion disks, and exoplanets. You can also find me at the [Center for Computational Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics) (Flatiron Institute), where I am always happy to chat about science over a cup of coffee!

I am passionate about supporting minorities in science and improving DEI. 

When I don't think about my research, I am a singer-songwriter and an amateur photographer.
