I'm excited to announce that I've been awarded a prestigious [Graduate Fellowship at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/apply/fellowships/graduate-fellowship-program) (KITP) at UC Santa Barbara! From January until June of 2025, I'll be diving into research among the palm trees and ocean breezes of beautiful Santa Barbara, California. I'll be participating in the program [Planet Formation and Migration near the Inner Edge of Disks](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/edgeplanets25). During my stay in California, I'm also looking forward to giving talks at various institutions - if you'd like to invite me to speak at your department, please reach out! Stay tuned for updates on my scientific adventures on the American Riviera!
