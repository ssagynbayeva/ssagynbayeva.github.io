So, I decided to start a blog. I have never wanted to be a blogger, but I love writing. And here I am, starting a blog with a hope that no one will read it, and I will just keep my thoughts to myself.

I’ve always loved, however, the idea of putting my thoughts somewhere, into some space. The thing is…I have a lot of them. I overthink a lot and I underthink, and there’s nothing in between. My thoughts are a mixture of very bright images of ideas, regrets, excitement, anxiety and opinions, nothing is structured there. There’s something about having fingers on a mechanical keyboard or holding a pen and producing words. Once I start writing, somehow, all the craziness inside my head makes sense. This is how I create my songs. They come from my experiences and from my desire to say something, and I realize only afterwards what it is I wanted to say so badly. 

My “blog” (or is it just a collection of words?) will not have one topic mostly because I was never passionate only about one thing, and I will certainly never have only one thing to say here. I will be writing about science, my learning journey, my thoughts about DEI issues in academia, and anything else I am passionate about. See you (hopefully) soon.
