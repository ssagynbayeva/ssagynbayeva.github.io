I am a regular writer for Astrobites, a website where graduate students publish daily summaries of recent papers on astro-ph. I am also actively involved in the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee in which we put effort to support DEI initiatives in STEM, both internal and external to the Astrobites collaboration.

I was an active volunteer at the "Education for all" center and the KIT inclusion club in Astana, organizations that help teenagers with mental and physical disabilities. Those are teenagers with autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, deafness, etc. I took part and organized our first inclusive musical theatre performances in Kazakhstan: "The Jungle Book," "Beauty and the Beast," and "Dreamers," the original musical. These performances were hugely covered in Kazakhstani media, e.g. on radio and TV programs.

I was a president of the *Women in Physics* club at Nazarbayev University, where we conducted meetings and different events to encourage female students to choose STEM-related majors and to provide support to those who have already chosen it. Some of the events we organized were a fundraising movie night to help a student with cancer (organized my the former president, Azel Murzabekova), a talk on feminism and women in science, etc. The important goal is to provide a safe space to female students and faculty in Physics at Nazarbayev University.
